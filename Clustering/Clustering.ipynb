        "# 8: Clustering\n",
        "K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups or clusters based on the similarity of data points. The goal of the K-means algorithm is to assign each data point to one of K clusters in a way that minimizes the sum of squared distances between data points and the centroid of their assigned cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the K-means algorithm works:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Initialization:** Choose K initial cluster centroids randomly or using a specific initialization method.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Assignment Step:** Assign each data point to the nearest centroid. The distance metric commonly used is Euclidean distance, but other distance metrics can be employed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Update Step:** Recalculate the centroids of the clusters based on the current assignment of data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Repeat:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence. Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly or when a specified number of iterations is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of K (the number of clusters) is a crucial parameter in K-means clustering and is often determined using methods like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "K-means clustering has several applications, such as customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, and more. It is an iterative algorithm that converges to a solution, and its efficiency makes it suitable for large datasets. However, K-means is sensitive to the initial choice of centroids and may converge to a local minimum, so multiple initializations or more advanced variants like K-means++ can be used to address this issue.\n",
